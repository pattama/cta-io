CTA-IO
========

This is the Input/Output Brick for cta project

First refer to cta-brick and cta-flowcontrol repositories to familiarize yourself with those concepts.

Like all bricks, IO Brick can be easily injected into a flowcontrol using a configuration

# Brick properties

* dependencies: this brick depends on cta-messaging tool to read & write to/from the outside. If it's not specified, it will use the default one. Refer to cta-messaging doc.
* inputQueue: this is the name of the queue where to read from as soon as the application is initialized.
  Received messages are published in the channel according to the publish configuration.
* inputMethod: "subscribe" (default) or "consume". Refer to [cta-messaging tool](/lib/io/README.md) doc to read more about these methods
* outputQueue: this is the name of the default output queue where to write to

Note that this brick can be used as a Receiver (Input) and/or a Sender (Output)
